# DivineBlade
 Creation of a new homebrew option for the *Warlock hexblade* players who want to make their pact with a good-aligned creature.

## When you choose this Homebrew?
 If you wanna play as a *Hexblade warrior* but you're tired of cursing someone's soul that you've killed as your slave, you should better run to **Divineblade**.
 As a **Divineblade** you will have access to:
 * Magic Weapon instead of Branding Smite at level 2;
 * Destructive Wave instead of Banishing Smite at level 5;
 * Your Accursed Specter feat becomes a Blessing Spirit feat making you purify the soul that has been killed by you instead of making him your slave;
 * And all of those bad things described by your subclass transformed into a good vibe.

 #### The **Divineblade's curse** was developed based on the **Warlock: The Hexblade** class from the role-playing game: **Dungeons & Dragons Xanathar's Guide to Everything** book.
