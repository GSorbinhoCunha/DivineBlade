                        <p>At 1st level, you gain proficiency with medium armor, shields, and martial weapons. In addition, when attacking with a melee weapon that you are proficient with and that lacks the two-handed property, you can use your Charisma modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity, for the attack and damage rolls.

The target is cursed for 1 minute. The curse ends early if the target dies, you die, or you are incapacitated. Until the curse ends, you gain the following benefits:
                            <ul>
                                <li>You gain a bonus to damage rolls against the cursed target. the bonus equals your proficiency bonus.</li>
                                <li>Any attack roll you make against the cursed target is a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20 on the d20.</li>
                                <li>If the cursed target dies, you regain hit points equal to your warlock level + your + <strong>CHA</strong> modifier.</li>

                        <p>At 1st level, you acquire the training necessary to effectively arm yourself for battle. You gain proficiency with medium armor, shields, and martial weapons.
                            The influence of your patron also allows you to mystically channel your will through a particular weapon. Whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch one 
                            weapon that you are proficient with and that lacks the two-handed property. When you attack with that weapon, you can use your Charisma modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity, 
                            for the attack and damage rolls. This benefit lasts until you finish a long rest. If you later gain the Pact of the Blade feature, this benefit extends to every pact weapon you conjure with that feature,
                            no matter the weapon's type.

                        <p>
                            Starting at 6th level, you can bless the soul of a person you killed, in the name of your patron. When you kill a humanoid, you can cause its spirit to rise from the celestial plane. When the spirit rises, your patron gives you a celestial to help you for a day, it gains temporary hit points equal to half your warlock level. Roll initiative for the celestial, which has its own turns. It follows your verbal commands, and it gains a special bonus to its attack rolls equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of +0).<br>
                            <br> The celestial remains summoned until the end of your next long rest, at which point it vanishes to the celestial plane.<br>
                            <br> Once you bless a soul with this feature, you can't use the feature again until you finish a long rest.

                            On a 4 or higher, the attack instead misses you, regardless of its roll.

                            Starting at 14th level, you can spread your Bless-blade's Curse from a slain creature to another creature. When the creature cursed by your Bless-blade's Curse dies,
                            you can apply the curse ti a different creature you can see within 30 feet of you, provided you aren't incapacitated.When you  apply the curse in this way,
                            you don't regain hit points from the death of the previously cursed creature.
